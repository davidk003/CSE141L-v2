# Milestone 1

## Introduction

* Learned that 4 registers is very hard to deal with as assembly requires a lot of manual memory access to keep track of variables.
* 2 register operands instructions take up a lot of space for operands alone.

### Possible adjustments
* Accumulator register architecture to half bits used for operands for a given instruction
* Better diagramming for easier transition to top level
* Working and verified assembly friendly C/C++ code before moving onto software

Possibly inspired off 6502?
