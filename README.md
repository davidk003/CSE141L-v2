# CSE141L Microprocessor V2
Inspired on the RISC 32I minimal ISA

## Part 1: ISA

### Requirements
* 9 bit Instructions
* 8 bit registers (8-bit intermediate max)
* ADD, LUT Load, 
* Logical shift left, logical shift right,
branch

### Nice to haves
Intermediate add, subtract
* Shiftoverleft/right(Special instruction for moving remaining bits of a given register to other register as overflow)
